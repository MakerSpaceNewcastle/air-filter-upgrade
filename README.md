# Air Filter Upgrade

Upgraded control system for Axminster air filter units.

## Usage

Button options (actions take effect when button is released):

- quick (< 3 seconds) press start/demand button: start fan if stopped, or reset timer to 20 minutes if already running
- long (>= 3 seconds) press start/demand button: stop fan
- quick press speed button: cycle fan speed if running

## Known issues

Sometimes the display can become unresponsive due to electrical noise from the contactors.
A power cycle will fix this.

## Wiring notes

From fan motor:

- black = N
- white = SL high speed
- yellow = SL medium speed
- blue = SL low speed
